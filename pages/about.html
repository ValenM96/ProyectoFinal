            <p>From an early age, my passion for art has been an integral part of my life. From the first strokes to complex 3D creations, I have always felt a deep connection with artistic expression.<br> My fascination with traditional sculpture took root in my childhood, and as I grew, my interest expanded into the digital realm.
Currently, I dedicate myself to 3D art, merging my love for sculpture with the most advanced technologies.<br> Specializing in creating characters and creatures, as well as crafting immersive environments, I have explored various aspects of three-dimensional design.
My versatility is reflected in my ability to master both organic modeling and hard surface modeling.<br> From the smoothness of organic forms to the geometric precision of hard surface modeling, I feel comfortable tackling a wide range of styles and techniques.<br>
With a solid command of a variety of specialized software, including ZBrush, Maya, Blender, Substance Painter, Unity, Unreal Engine 5, and Photoshop, I have the necessary tools to bring my creative visions to life.<br>
Passionate about the world of video games, I channel my love for 3D art by working as a freelance artist. This freedom allows me to explore new creative horizons, collaborate with diverse clients, and participate in exciting projects that challenge my skills and inspire me to continue growing as an artist.
